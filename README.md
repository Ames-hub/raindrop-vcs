# What is Raindrop?
Raindrop is a Version Control System (VCS), similar to GitHub.<br>
However, unlike GitHub, we are completely free, and we offer no premium features<br>
because all features are available to all. So this means no project size limits for one.<br>

It is also inspired by Jetbrains Space, which is a program I saw which looked very
handy but was only available for certain groups/people. So in future implementations, I may be making my own free 
version of it here.

This is a tool primarily meant for developers, but can be used by anyone.<br>

# Features / Roadmap

As some may be out of date or have had completely disabled the feature.**

## Usage of Raindrop
Raindrop, unlike Git which uses the terminal, primarily uses a WebUI.<br>
So you can use Raindrop from any device, as long as you have a browser.

Either the person hosting Raindrop for you will provide you with a link, or you can host it yourself<br>
and Raindrop will tell you the link there.<br>

To those hosting Raindrop, I encourage you to visit the docs/hosting.md file for more information.<br>
This will contain detailed, step-by-step installation data for Linux and Windows 10+ and other useful information.

## How does it work?
Raindrop uses a system of pushes, branches and merges to manage your code, Much like GitHub.<br>
However unlike GitHub, it does not have 'commits', you push your code, and it is saved.<br>

This has been a simple overview<br>
For further details, see the docs/vcs.md file.
